<!-- Radix is a Component Library built on top of [Radix System](/docs/radix-system). -->

### Installing Radix

Radix is currently under heavy development, but can be installed by running either of these commands:

```
npm install @modulz/radix
```

<br />
or

```
yarn add @modulz/radix
```

### Radix Provider

Make sure to wrap your app in `RadixProvider` to get the default theme:

```js
import { RadixProvider } from '@modulz/radix';

const App = () => <RadixProvider>Hey thereðŸ‘‹</RadixProvider>;
```

### Importing components from Radix

All components can be imported directly:

```js
import { Heading, Text, Link } from '@modulz/radix';
```
